HP Omen special feature control for Linux
-----------------------------------------

This is a version of the hp-wmi kernel module that implements some of the features of HP Omen Command Centre.

It's totally experimental right now, and could easily crash your machine. As such I'm not going to provide any instructions just yet.

Currently working:

FourZone keyboard colour control (/sys/devices/platforms/hp-wmi/rgb-zones)

To do:

FourZone brightness control
Fan control
Performance level
Network booster (?)
